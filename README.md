# TelexO
Teensy 4.0 expander for Telex

* Connects to Telex via i2c
* 4 additional trigger outputs
* 4 additional CV outputs
* CV outs can be driven to audio range (so four oscillators or LFOs)
* Triggers can have individual metronomes
* Lots more advanced features

Still WIP - the CV scaling is off, but the oscillators work very nicely.
